				<br>From childhood’s hour I have not been 
				<br>As others were—I have not seen 
				<br>As others saw—I could not bring 
				<br>My passions from a common spring—

				<h2>
				<br>From the same source I have not taken 
				<br>My sorrow—I could not awaken 
				<br>My heart to joy at the same tone— 
				<br>And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—

				<br>Then—in my childhood—in the dawn 
				<br>Of a most stormy life—was drawn 
				<br>From ev’ry depth of good and ill
				<br>The mystery which binds me still— 
				</h3>
				<br>From the torrent, or the fountain— 
				<br>From the red cliff of the mountain— 
				<br>From the sun that ’round me roll’d 
				<br>In its autumn tint of gold— 
				<h4>
				<br>From the lightning in the sky 
				<br>As it pass’d me flying by— 
				<br>From the thunder, and the storm— 
				<br>And the cloud that took the form 
				</h4>
				<h5>
				<br>(When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
				<br>Of a demon in my view
